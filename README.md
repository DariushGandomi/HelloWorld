# Hello World Project

---
### Itâ€™s not that hard of a task, but there are always simple yet important things to consider while implementing your ideas into lines of code.

### In this Project, I tried to implement the idea of printing "Hello World, hooray !" with suitable class name format (camel case, etc.), enough **spacing between the words and lines** and enough **indentation**, plus, I did my best on adding **not needed files** to *.gitignore* file, then commiting and pushing what's needed to my GitHub.

## How to run the file

### In order to run it, you only need to run HelloWorld.java file on your IDE (i.e. IntelliJ IDEA).

### It will automatically compile the HelloWorld.java file by the installed JDK on your device to a HelloWorld.class file and then run it by JVM (JRE).

### Hope you like it :)
